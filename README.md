problem statement

Labor Ocean is a website that aims to reduce agony of finding professionals and specialists in hands-on services such as plumbers, electricians, veterinary doctors, carpenters, masons, chauffeurs and many more. Most individuals struggle a lot in readily connecting with persons possessing the skills named earlier as the demand for some of the services tends to be very urgent. For example, looking for a plumber to fix a leaking water system. Labor Ocean will provide several experts in various fields, who will be available for hiring just a click away. Thus, it will save a lot of time for our clients and reduce damages or wastages resulting from the time taken to get an appointment. Likewise, our specialists will get to build more on their experience, skills, and customer relations.

Purpose of the project

Labor Ocean provides the user with a list of the various services whose technicians have registered with the company and are available for booking. The services will be displayed, and clients can select one they need. At checkout, the service chosen will be marked as an appointment. A booking form is provided to the user for the convenience of online appointment booking. Clients can pay for the services after it has been rendered upon inspection. There is also Security for our client’s confidential information, given that there is the usage of login IDs and passwords to limit unauthorized users from accessing the accounts.

Technical requirements

Python entirely powers the Labor Ocean website. In frontend coding, the site uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap; for the back-end, I’ve employed python’s Django web framework and SQLite database, which comes by default with Django. Likewise, this project requires the knowledge of python and the basics of Django Framework as a skillset to build. The scheme is built using VS Code, a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.
